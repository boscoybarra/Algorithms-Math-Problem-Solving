# Algorithms-Math-Problem-Solving

This repository aims to set some mathematical questions and answer for small problem-solving.
It is not only a good exercise for me to solve them and share them with you but also a good way to post snippets of code that together can solve a greater problem.


# Features

- Some of them are written in Swift 4.0
- Files are in Swift Playgrounds.
- Recently I have included also some fun exercise in JavaScript




## Problems

> #### 1. Problem. Award Budget Cuts.
*  Check README.md for all the details in the corresponding folder.




### Tech

The problems uses the following tech:

* [Swift] - Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.
* [Xcode] - Xcode is a complete developer toolset for creating apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.
* [JavaScript] - I'm running the code in Atom using a cool plugin called: Script. To run simply hit command + i


### Installation for Xcode Exercises


**Simply make sure you have Xcode's latest version and open the file**

1. Select the problem you are interested in look at.
2. Try to solve it by your self.
3. Check the hints.
4. Contrast your solution with the solution given.


### Todos

 - Add the option to include collaborations.
 - Improve Swift syntax for the hints and solutions.
